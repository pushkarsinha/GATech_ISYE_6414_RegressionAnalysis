Let Y^∗ be the predicted response at x^∗ . The variance of Y^∗ given x^∗ depends on both the value of x^∗ and the design matrix.	True (but the wording was confusing, so everyone got credit no matter what on this question)
Suppose x1 was not found to be significant in the model specified with lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3). Then x1 will also not be significant in the model lm(y ~ x1 + x2).	False
