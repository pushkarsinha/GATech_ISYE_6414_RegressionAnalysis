The prediction interval of one member of the population will always be larger than the confidence interval of the mean response for all members of the population when using the same predicting values. (T/F)	True.

See 1.7 Regression Line: Estimation & Prediction Examples

"Just to wrap up the comparison, the confidence intervals under estimation are narrower than the prediction intervals because the prediction intervals have additional variance from the variation of a new measurement."
In ANOVA, the linearity assumption is assessed using a plot of the response against the predicting variable. (T/F)	False.

See 2.2 - Estimation Method
Linearity is not an assumption of Anova.
If the model assumptions hold, then the estimator for the variance, σ ^ 2, is a random variable. (T/F)	True

See 1.8 Statistical Inference
We assume that the error terms are independent random variables. Therefore, the residuals are independent random variables. Since σ ^ 2 is a combination of the residuals, it is also a random variable.

See 2.4 Test for Equal Means.
MSE = within-group variability
The simple linear regression coefficient, β ^ 0, is used to measure the linear relationship between the predicting and response variables. (T/F)	False

See 1.2 Estimation Method
β ^ 0 is the intercept and does not tell us about the relationship between the predicting and response variables.
The sampling distribution for the variance estimator in simple linear regression is χ 2 (chi-squared) regardless of the assumptions of the data. (T/F)	False

See 1.2 Estimation Method
"The sampling distribution of the estimator of the variance is chi-squared, with n - 2 degrees of freedom (more on this in a moment). This is under the assumption of normality of the error terms."
β ^ 1 is an unbiased estimator for β 0. (T/F)	False

See 1.4 Statistical Inference

If the pairwise comparison interval between groups in an ANOVA model includes zero, we conclude that the two means are plausibly equal. (T/F)	True

See 2.8 Data Example
If the comparison interval includes zero, then the two means are not statistically significantly different, and are thus, plausibly equal.
Under the normality assumption, the estimator for β 1 is a linear combination of normally distributed random variables. (T/F)	True

See 1.4 Statistical Inference
"Under the normality assumption, β 1 is thus a linear combination of normally distributed random variables... β ^ 0 is also linear combination of random variables"
An ANOVA model with a single qualitative predicting variable containing k groups will have k + 1 parameters to estimate. (T/F)	True

See 2.2 Estimation Method
We have to estimate the means of the k groups and the pooled variance estimator, s pooled ^2.
In simple linear regression models, we lose three degrees of freedom when estimating the variance because of the estimation of the three model parameters β 0 , β 1 , σ^2. (T/F)	False.

See 1.2 Estimation Method
"The estimator for σ 2 is σ ^ 2, and is the sum of the squared residuals, divided by n - 2."
We lose two degrees of freedom because the variance estimator, σ ^ 2, uses only the estimates for β 0, and β 1 in its calculation.
The pooled variance estimator, s pooled^2, in ANOVA is synonymous with the variance estimator, σ ^ 2, in simple linear regression because they both use mean squared error (MSE) for their calculations. (T/F)	True.

See 1.2 Estimation Method for simple linear regression
See 2.2 Estimation Method for ANOVA

See 1.8 Diagnostics
"Normality assumption: the error terms are normally distributed."
The response may or may not be normally distributed, but the error terms are assumed to be normally distributed.
If the constant variance assumption in ANOVA does not hold, the inference on the equality of the means will not be reliable. (T/F)	True

See 2.8 Data Example
"This is important since without a good fit, we cannot rely on the statistical inference."
Only when the model is a good fit, i.e. all model assumptions hold, can we rely on the statistical inference.
A negative value of β 1 is consistent with an inverse relationship between the predictor variable and the response variable. (T/F)	True

See 1.2 Estimation Method
"A negative value of β 1 is consistent with an inverse relationship"
The p-value is a measure of the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. (T/F)	False

See 1.5 Statistical Inference Data Example
"p-value is a measure of how rejectable the null hypothesis is... It's not the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, nor is it the probability that the null hypothesis is true."
We assess the constant variance assumption by plotting the error terms, ϵ i, against fitted values. (T/F)	False

See 1.2 Estimation Method
"We use ϵ ^ i as proxies for the deviances or the error terms. We don't have the deviances because we don't have β 0 and β 1.
With the Box-Cox transformation, when λ = 0 we do not transform the response. (T/F)	False.

See 1.8 Diagnostics
When λ = 0, we transform using the normal log.
The sampling distribution of β ^ 0 is a:
A. t-distribution
B. chi-squared distribution
C. normal distribution
D. None of the above	A. t-distribution

See 1.4 Statistical Inference
The distribution of β 0 is normal. Since we are using a sample and not the full population, the sampling distribution of β ^ 0 is the t-distribution.
A data point far from the mean of the x's and y's is always:
A. an influential point and an outlier
B. a leverage point but not an outlier
C. an outlier and a leverage point
D. an outlier but not a leverage point
E. None of the above	E. None of the Above.

See 1.9 Outliers and Model Evaluation
We only know that the data point is far from the mean of x's and y's. It only fits the definition of a leverage point because the only information we know is that it is far from the mean of the x's. So you can eliminate the answers that do not include a leverage point. That leaves us with remaining possibilities, "a leverage point but not an outlier" and "an outlier and a leverage point" , both of which we can eliminate. We do not have enough information to know if it is or is not an outlier . None of the answers above fit the criteria of it being always being a leverage point.

See 2.4 Test for Equal Means
"Using the hypothesis testing procedure for equal means, we test: The null hypothesis, which that the means are all equal (mu 1 = mu 2...=mu k) versus the alternative hypothesis, that some means are different. Not all means have to be different for the alternative hypothesis to be true -- at least one pair of the means needs to be different."

In multiple linear regression, the estimated regression coefficient corresponding to a quantitative predicting variable is interpreted as the estimated expected change in the response variable when there is a change of one unit in the corresponding predicting variable holding all other predictors fixed. (T/F)	True.

See Lesson 3.4: Model Interpretation
"The estimated value for one of the regression coefficient βi represents the estimated expected change in y associated with one unit of change in the corresponding predicting variable, Xi, holding all else in the model fixed."

See Lesson 3.3: Regression Parameter Estimation
The estimated variance of the error terms of a multiple linear regression model with intercept should be obtained by summing up the squared residuals and dividing that by n-p-1, where n is the sample size and p is the number of predictors as we lose p+1 degrees of freedom when we estimate the p coefficients and 1 intercept.
For a given predicting variable, the corresponding estimated regression coefficient will likely be different in a conditional model versus a marginal model. (T/F)	True.

Conducting t-tests on each β parameter in a multiple linear regression model is the preferable to an F-test when testing the overall significance of the model. (T/F)	False.

See Lesson 3.7: Testing for Subsets of Coefficients
"We cannot and should not select the combination of predicting variables that most explains the variability in the response based on the t-tests for statistical significance because the statistical significance depends on what other variables are in the model."

See Lesson 3.13: Model Evaluation and Multicollinearity
It is good practice to create a multiple linear regression model using a linearly independent set of predicting variables. "XTX is not invertible if the columns of X are linearly dependent, i.e. one predicting variable, corresponding to one column, is a linear combination of the others."
The causation of a predicting variable to the response variable can be captured using multiple linear regression on observational data, conditional of other predicting variables in the model. (T/F)	False.

See Lesson 3.4 Model Interpretation
"This is particularly prevalent in a context of making causal statements when the setup of the regression does not allow so. Causality statements can only be made in a controlled environment such as randomized trials or experiments. "
For a multiple linear regression model to be a good fit, we need the linearity assumption to hold for only one of the predicting variables. (T/F)	False

See Lesson 3.11: Assumptions and diagnostics
In multiple linear regression, we need the linearity assumption to hold for all of the predicting variables, for the model to be a good fit. "For example, if the linearity does not hold with one or more predicting variables, then we could transform the predicting variables to improve the linearity assumption."
Multicollinearity among the predicting variables will not impact the standard errors of the estimated regression coefficients. (T/F)	False.

See Lesson 3.13: Multicollinearity

In multiple linear regression, the prediction of the response variable and the estimation of the mean response have the same interpretation. (T/F)	False.

See Lesson 3.2.9: Regression Line and Predicting a New Response.
In multiple linear regression, the prediction of the response variable and the estimation of the mean response do not have the same interpretation.
Cook's distance (Di) measures how much the fitted values in a multiple linear regression model change when the ith observation is removed. (T/F)	True.

See Lesson 3.11: Assumptions and Diagnostics
"This is the distance between the fitted values of the model with all the observations versus the fitted values of the model discarding the i-th observation from the data used to fit the model. "
If the residuals are not normally distributed, we can model the transformed response variable instead, where a common transformation for normality is the Box-Cox transformation. (T/F)	True.
